# Grid-based Visual Representation of Path Planning Algorithm
I created a code in which we can set start point, end point and obstacles in grid-map, and can use any (currently only Dijkstra) Path Planning Algorithm to solve path between start and end point
## How to operate
1) Run main.py, a grid will appear
2) Hold `s` and left-click a cell in the grid using mouse. It will create a starting point
3) Hold `e` and left-click a cell in the grid using mouse. It will create a ending point
4) Hold `o` and left-click a cell in the grid using mouse. It will create obstacles
5) Now press enter, it will solve grid automatically using Dijkstra's Algorithm

I will add A* algorithm later
